# 16-Bit-CPU-Logisim
This 16-bit CPU, built in Logisim, operates on a 16-bit architecture and integrates key components such as the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit, Registers, and Memory. It supports around 20 instructions, including arithmetic operations, logical comparisons, memory manipulation, and advanced tasks like matrix multiplication. The Control Unit manages instruction execution, while the ALU handles core operations like addition, subtraction, and logical comparisons. This project offers hands-on experience in understanding CPU functionality and data processing.
The flow of data and operations is controlled by Read-Only Memory (ROM), which contains binary instructions (1 for ON, 0 for OFF) that activate different components within the CPU. The instructions in ROM A and ROM B are created by carefully simulating data flow through the CPU using truth tables.
